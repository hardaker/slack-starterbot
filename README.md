# Overview

This starter bot derivers from the slack-starterbot by @mattmakai, but
I added a number of features that makes it slightly easier to get
stared and just create commands within functions.  Details below.

# Original text from @mattmakai

## slack-starterbot
A simple Python-powered starter Slack bot. Read

for a full overview.

# Modifications by @hardaker:

- Created a simple command registration and routing system
- Created a help system
- Added example commands: help, echo, whoami
- very simple (bad) data saving in a json file
